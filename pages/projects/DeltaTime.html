                    Delta Time is a thrilling 2D platform game that was developed by a team of five people, including two programmers, two art designers, and one level designer. As the leader of the team and one of the programmers, I am proud to present this game as the final project for our school.
                    <br>&nbsp;<br>
                    The game is a rogue-like platformer, which means that each playthrough is unique and unpredictable. The player must travel through various maps, defeat enemies, and gather power-ups to become stronger. The ultimate goal is to defeat bosses and progress to the next level.
                    <br>&nbsp;<br>
                    As the leader of the team, I was responsible for overseeing the development process, coordinating with my team members, and ensuring that everything was on track and on schedule. I also took an active role in programming, working with my team to implement new features and ensure that the game was functioning correctly.

                    As the leader of the development team for Delta Time, I gained valuable experience in project management, delegation, and problem-solving. I was responsible for overseeing the entire development process, communicating with my team members, and ensuring that everything was on track and on schedule. This required me to have excellent time management skills and the ability to delegate tasks effectively, while also being available to assist team members as needed. My leadership was essential to the team's ability to work together towards a common goal and helped to ensure the success of the project.
